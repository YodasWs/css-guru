title: An Ode to Mathematics

<p>When I am working on various unique projects, I often come to a problem that requires
mathematics to solve, like a calculator for loan interest and payments, or my most recent
project involving optimizing profits earned from various items used to make different goods.
When I was in university, I did not care much for applied maths, something I am now kicking
myself for not studying more. If anyone believes studying math is not important, then they never
cared about making or saving money.</p>

<p>It takes years of study to begin to appreciate mathematics. True mathematics, unlike
accounting or statistics, is about finding solutions to a problem, not plugging numbers into an
equation. <em>This</em> is why I have always enjoyed mathematics and why every organization needs
a mathematician.</p>
