<h1>Minimalist HTML5</h1>
<p>HTML from its inception in 1991 has been about semantically marking up documents. With the growth of graphic displays, web developers have been trying to transform HTML into a style sheet language, but the <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> tag and imprecise attributes left much to be desired, and so CSS was created in 1996. The ideal of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_presentation_and_content" target="_blank">separating presentation and content</a> also brought forth XML, an HTML-like markup language distilled into pure semantics and zero presentation/styling demands, leaving presentation to separate style sheets in CSS or XSL. Sadly, though, XML's requirement to be <q>well-formed</q> proved too strict as kludging HTML into attractive web pages had become standard practice.</p>
<p>Today the same content may be picked up and displayed in various different contexts. You main content is now scraped to display in Google searches, Facebook posts, aggragate sites, maybe even previews on your own homepage.</p>
<p>And now, with the myriad of different devices that connect to the Internet and display web content, it is necessary to show the same content with many different layouts.</p>
<p>Use minimalist, semantic HTML5 with no superfluous, unnecessary markup.</p>
<p>E.g., donÂ’t nest layers of divs when you may need only one article and one section.</p>
<p>E.g., CSS3 gradients are smaller, easier to edit, and load faster than images</p>
<h2>Clear Floats</h2>
<p>There is no need for arbitrary, useless HTML markup. </p>
<h3>Before</h3>
<pre>
div.clear {
	float: none; clear: both;
}
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div class="clear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
		<h3>After</h3>
<pre>
div::after {
	display: block; content: ''; float: none; clear: both;
}
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
